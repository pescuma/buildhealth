Idea
----

A tool that runs after a build and gather metrics to determine if a build was successful or not. Currently we use CI servers to do that but if you run your build locally you don't receive any feedback. (A second problem is that all CI servers end up duplicating the code to process the build results, but this is a problem too big to think about now).

So, this is a tool that receive as inputs the results of the build (test results, code coverage files, etc), process them and output if the build is GOOD, PROBLEMATIC or SO SO. 

Some goals for this project: it should be easy to create plugins for this tool to process new kinds of output. Also, it would be good if the results can be used by other tools (to be displayed in different formats). Lastly, it would be good if the tool could store the results from previous builds to tell if the quality has improved or not.



Interface
---------

You can use this through two interfaces: the command line and inside an `ant` build script.

Let's first see some examples

### Command line interface (cli)

The way it works is: you first create a build, then you add data to it and finally you call report to see the status of your build. At this point you can also call the notify command to receive nofications with the report.

To call the cli: `java -jar buildhealth-0.X.jar`. For Windows you can use the exe version.

##### Creates a new build
This must be done before adding data
```
> buildhealth new
```

##### Add junit tests
```
> buildhealth add junit /path/to/xmls
File processed: /path/to/xmls/TEST-test1.xml
File processed: /path/to/xmls/TEST-test2.xml
File processed: /path/to/xmls/TEST-test2.xml
```

##### Add coverage
```
> buildhealth add jacoco /path/to/xmls
File processed: /path/to/xmls/coverage.xml
```

##### Compute tasks
Tasks are `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK`/`XXX` comments on your code
```
> buildhealth compute tasks /path/to/sources
File computed: /home/pescuma/.buildhealth/computed/tasks.csv
File processed: /home/pescuma/.buildhealth/computed/tasks.csv
```

##### List available configurations
```
> buildhealth config list
Coverage:
    coverage good = <no limit> [Minimun coverage for a Good build]
    coverage warn = <no limit> [Minimun coverage for a So So build]
    coverage <type> good = <no limit> [Minimun coverage for a Good build]
    coverage <type> warn = <no limit> [Minimun coverage for a So So build]
    coverage maintype = instruction,line [Which coverage type will represent the global coverage (can have more than one, separated by ',', with the most import ant first)]

Disk usage:
    diskUsage reportWithTags = true [If file tags should be used in the full report tree]

Performance:
    performace runsPerS good = <no limit> [Minimun runs per second for a Good build]
    performace runsPerS warn = <no limit> [Minimun runs per second for a Good build]
    performace ms good = <no limit> [Maximun run time (ms) for a Good build]
    performace ms warn = <no limit> [Maximun run time (ms) for a Good build]
    performace report = <ms if both available, else what is available> [How to show the agregated results (runsPerS or ms)]

Static analysis:
    staticanalysis good = <no limit> [Maximun munber of violations for a Good build]
    staticanalysis warn = <no limit> [Maximun munber of violations for a So So build]
    staticanalysis <language> good = <no limit> [Maximun munber of violations for a Good build]
    staticanalysis <language> warn = <no limit> [Maximun munber of violations for a So So build]
    staticanalysis <language> <framework> good = <no limit> [Maximun munber of violations for a Good build]
    staticanalysis <language> <framework> warn = <no limit> [Maximun munber of violations for a So So build]

Growl notifier:
    notification growl enabled = true [Growl server name]
    notification growl server = localhost [Growl server name]
    notification growl port = 23053 [Growl server port]
```


##### Set config parameters
```
> buildhealth config set coverage good = 70
```

##### Get report
```
> buildhealth report
Your build is GOOD
    Unit tests: PASSED [109 tests, 109 passed (1.4 s)]
    Coverage: 73% [class: 50%, method: 56%, line: 67%, branch: 57%, instruction: 73%, complexity: 52%]
    Static analysis: 103 [FindBugs: 17, PMD: 60, Tasks: 26]
    Lines of code: 9.1k [2.0k blank, 6.9k code, 194 comment, in 164 files]
    Disk usage: 10.5 MiB
```

##### Get detailed report on one item
```
> buildhealth report "Unit tests"
Unit tests: PASSED [109 tests, 109 passed (1.4 s)]
    Java: PASSED [109 tests, 109 passed (1.4 s)]
...
```

##### Notify
```
> buildhealth notify
Sent growl notification
```

##### Start web server to see the report as an HTML page
```
> buildhealth webserver
Web server started at http://localhost:8190
Available urls:
  http://localhost:8190/            => Browse the reports as a web site
  http://localhost:8190/report.json => Report in JSON format
  http://localhost:8190/report.xml  => Report in XML format

Hit Enter to stop...
```

### `ant` task

There is one `ant` task that does everything. In this case you don't need to call `new` or `report`, using the task means that the new is the first thing and the report is the last one.

```xml
<taskdef resource="org/pescuma/buildhealth/ant/antlib.xml" classpath="${build.dir}/buildhealth-${version}.jar" />

<buildhealth home="${reports.dir}/builhealth" notify="true">
   <config key="coverage good" value="70" />
	<add-junit>
		<fileset dir="${build.dir}">
			<include name="**/reports/junit/*" />
		</fileset>
	</add-junit>
	<add-jacoco dir="${jacoco.dir}" />
	<compute-tasks>
		<fileset dir="${source.dir}">
			<include name="**/*.java" />
		</fileset>
	</compute-tasks>
</buildhealth>
```

### `add` x `compute`

If you noticied, in the previous examples, some commands start with _add_ and others start with _compute_. The difference is what the command will do.

 - `add` commands only read results processed by other tools (internally they are called extractors). Most of the commands are like this.
 - `compute` commands execute some task (for example parse the sources to find tasks), outputting and intermediary file with results, and then add that data to the build results (internally they call an extractor after doing its job).

The ant tasks have the same name, with an - in the midde. For eg. `add pmd` command is equivalent to the ant task `add-pmd`.

Implementation
--------------

This is implemented in 2 stages: the first gather the data and put in a big table (extractors) and the second summarizes it (analysers). The advantage is that this format could group different results of different tools that have the same purpose.

The table have as 1st column a number and in consecutive columns the specific information of what the number means, from most generic to most specific. So, for eg, for unit tests:
```
35,Unit test,Java,JUnit,passed
1,Unit test,Java,JUnit,failed
22,Unit test,C++,CppUnit,passed
3,Unit test,C#,NUnit,failed
```

So, you'd have plugins to add data to the table and plugins to summarize it.

To store the data, you can specify a folder or by default it uses a folder in your home called `.buildhealth`.

Some other features that I think could be useful (but aren't implemented yet):
 - Store the data in a format that is good to store in VCS (eg git)
 - Store metadata about the build (where the data came from, etc)
 - Add option to have multiple build data, so we can report the diffs
 - Be able to add ids and parents to builds (to correctly determine if it improved or not)
 - A jenkins plugin to show colected data
